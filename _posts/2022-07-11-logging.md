In this post, we look at deploying a logging layer on (and for) Hashi@Home.
As one of the commonly-identified triad of an observability platform, it is an important part of any production environment.
In [Monitoring]({% post_url 2022-01-01-monitoring %}) we went through the motions of selecting what we would use for monitoring, and Prometheus came out on top.

After doing a bit more research, I decided that the logging component for Hashi at Home would be based on Grafana Loki, which would essentially play nicely with Prometheus.

## Logging Game Plan

Loki works similarly to Prometheus in that an agent on an endpoint collects data (logs in this case, metrics in the case of Prometheus), which are then centralised to a central storage system.

The overall plan then is to deploy the log scrapers first as a system job, and then the actual logging system, Loki itself, once we are actually ready to collect data.

So, we would have a `promtail.nomad` system job and a `loki.nomad` service job.

{% highlight hcl %}
#promtail.nomad

variable "promtail_version" {}

job "promtail" {

  type = "system"
  group "promtail" {
    network {
      port "http" {}
      port "grpc" {}
    }

    service {
      name = "promtail"
      port = "http"

      check {
        name     = "promtail-alive"
        type     = "tcp"
      }

      check {
        name = "Promtail HTTP"
        type = "http"
        path = "/ready"
        port = "http"
      }
    }

    task "promtail" {
      driver = "raw_exec"
      config {
        command = "promtail"
        args = ["-config.file=local/promtail.yml"]
      }

      artifact {
        source = "https://github.com/grafana/loki/releases/download/v${var.promtail_version}/promtail-linux-${attr.cpu.arch}.zip"
        destination = "local/promtail"
        mode = "file"
      }
      template {
         data          = file("templates/promtail.yml.tpl")
         destination   = "local/promtail.yml"
         change_mode   = "signal"
         change_signal = "SIGHUP"
      }
    }
  }
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Promtail

{% highlight bash %}

+ Job: "promtail"
+ Task Group: "promtail" (11 create)
  + Task: "promtail" (forces create)

Scheduler dry-run:
- All tasks successfully allocated.

Job Modify Index: 0
To submit the job with version verification run:

nomad job run -check-index 0 promtail.nomad

When running the job with the check-index flag, the job will only be run if the
job modify index given matches the server-side version. If the index has
changed, another user has modified the job and the plan's results are
potentially invalid.
