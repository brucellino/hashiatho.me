## Backstory

A long time ago[^DevOpsTime] a major unsolved problem faced by operators was how to codify operational knowledge into appropriate remediation steps.

The basic premise was that if you observed the failures in your system long enough, then patterns would emerge, which you could identify, analyse and create solutions for.
The canonical example here is the "disk full" alert.
The lifecycle of this problem would go a bit like this:

1. Deploy an application which consumes storage space onto a machine, with zero alarms
1. Application starts to consume storage until eventually the storage is full
1. Application fails to write data, throws errors
1. Operator gets called[^somehow], and investigates
1. After a frantic initial hack, operator figures the algorithm that will eliminate this type of error

At this point, the

{% highlight python %}
if(disk_almost_full):
  alert_operator(runbook)
{% endhighlight %}

Someone responds to the incident, reads the ticket,

[^DevOpsTime]: In DevOps time, "a long time ago" basically means "before Kubernetes"
[^somehow]: Operator gets called _somehow_ -- again we're following LolProd principles here, so there is zero monitoring
