### Can I touch?

No. You can look, but don't touch.

### Is this like a tutorial or something?

No. This is a story about using Hashi stuff at home. If you're reading from the future, this was the time when literally _everyone_ was at home all the time, so it may seem weird in 2099, but back in pandemic days, this was pretty normal.

### Are you sure this is _only_ about Hashi tools?

Ok fine, you got me. It's _mostly_ about Hashi stuff. There's some Ansible and probably other things thrown in too.

### What did you use to build this website?

Glad you asked. I spent a while thinking about it, questioning my entire belief system. Short version:

- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for the content management
- [Swiss theme](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss) for the styling
- [atom](https://atom.io) as an editor
- [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) for the hosting
- [Hover](https://hover.com) for the domain name.

Long version might come in a blog post sometime.

### Can I have the source code so that I can do this to my pis too?

Sure. I'll release it when I'm ready.

### So are you some kind of Hashispert now? Can you help me?

No. I'm not Hashi certified anything, I just use these things a lot and really like them. I like to hang out on the [Hashicorp discussion forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com), mostly because it's a Discourse and I miss Discourse -- but also because the community there is really engaged and helpful.
I suggest you go there for Hashihelp.

### Are you literally going to just put Hashi in front of everything now?

Jury's out. It worked for Batman and the Smurfs, so who am I to judge?
