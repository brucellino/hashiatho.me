- q: Why?
  a: |-
    In case you slept through 2020, it was a pandemic year. The lucky ones had to stay at home a lot; that's the _"@home"_ part. The Hashi part is described in []

- q: Can I touch?
  a: |-
    No. You can look, but don't touch.

- q: Is this like a tutorial or something?
  a: |-
    No. This is a story about using Hashi stuff at home. If you're reading from the future, this was the time when literally _everyone_ was at home all the time, so it may seem weird in 2099, but back in pandemic days, this was pretty normal.

- q: Are you sure this is _only_ about Hashi tools?
  a: |-
    Ok fine, you got me. It's _mostly_ about Hashi stuff. There's some Ansible and probably other things thrown in too.

- q: What did you use to build this website?
  a: |-
    Glad you asked. I spent a while thinking about it, questioning my entire belief system. Short version:

    - [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for the content management
    - [Swiss theme](https://github.com/broccolini/swiss) for the styling
    - [atom](https://atom.io) as an editor
    - [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) for the hosting
    - [Hover](https://hover.com) for the domain name.

    Long version might come in a blog post sometime.

- q: Can I have the source code so that I can do this to my pis too?
  a: Sure. It's in a different repo and I'll release it when I'm ready.

- q: So are you some kind of Hashispert now? Can you help me?
  a: |-
    No. I'm not Hashi certified anything, I just use these things a lot and really like them. I like to hang out on the [Hashicorp discussion forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com), mostly because it's a Discourse and I miss Discourse -- but also because the community there is really engaged and helpful.
    I suggest you go there for Hashihelp.

- q: Are you literally going to just put Hashi in front of everything now?
  a: Jury's out. It worked for Batman and the Smurfs, so who am I to judge?
